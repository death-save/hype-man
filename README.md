Every hero needs a hype person* in their corner, getting the crowd amped up whenever they arrive.

With Hype Track you can give your players that experience by setting a Hype Track that plays when it is their turn in combat.

 *note: the playlist will be empty to start*

 Add tracks you want to use for your players here. I suggest short punchy clips no longer than 30s for best effect.

 Now open the Actor sheet for your players' characters and click the new Hype button that shows up.

 In the form that pops up, select the appropriate track from the Hype Tracks playlist
